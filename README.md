The design process can be found in the following github page. [DESIGN DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/KevinKipkorir254/study_notes_control_kit.git)

## Features


 - *Control Systems*: Design and implement PID controllers, compensators, and state-space controllers.
 - *System Identification*: Tools to aid in identifying dynamic systems from input-output data.
 - *Filtering*: Implement Kalman filters, state observers, and other filtering techniques.
 - *Integration with ROS 2*: Seamlessly interfaces with ROS 2 for advanced robotics and control applications.
